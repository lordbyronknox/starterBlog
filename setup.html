      file that you cloned the repo to and create an index.html file.</p> 
      <p>4. In
      index.html type 'doc' and click tab. (this will give you the boilerplate
      code). 
    </p>

    </p>

        MAKING CHANGES:
    </p>
      <p>1. Add a .css file with
      some styling. </p> 
      <p>
        2. In index.html add a 'link' tag to the '.css' file (under
      the title) 
    </p>
      <p>
        3. commit and push - changes will be applied to the page. </p>
      <p>
      Note:
      The page only reflects the main branch so merge any branches if needed.
      OR... if you want a branch to be hosted you can change the branch in
      Github pages from main to the branch. (You can change freely between
      branches).
