SETUP:

1. create new repository in Github.
2. Clone repository.
3. open file that you cloned the repo to and create an index.html file.
4. In index.html type 'doc' and click tab. (this will give you the boilerplate code).
5. Commit and push.
6. Github -> go to SETTINGS -> GITHUB PAGES
   Set 'Source' to 'main', folder as 'root', and save.
   The page is hosted - A url will be generated - top of Pages.

MAKING CHANGES:

1. Add a .css file with some styling.
2. In index.html add a <link> tag to the .css file (under the <title>)
3. commit and push - changes will be applied to the page.

Note:
The page only reflects the main branch so merge any branches if needed.
OR... if you want a branch to be hosted you can change the branch in Github pages from main to the branch. (You can change freely between branches).

Add a link

1. Create a second page/s - eg. setup.html
2. index.html -> add an anchor tag <a href="/starterBlog/setup.html"> with the path to the new page.
